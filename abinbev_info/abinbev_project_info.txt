INTRO:
Initially, to develop the case as comprehensively as possible, all databases were uploaded to the cloud on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), allowing the entire data transformation process to be conducted directly via BigQuery. Through a direct connection between GCP and Power BI, near real-time access to updated data is obtained, eliminating the need for manual pipelines or intermediary files. This more dynamic and automated workflow leads to a significant increase in productivity and a smoother data analysis experience, making dashboard development and updates faster and more reliable.

PAGE 1: MAPPING REVENUE LEADERS
The first analysis aims to map the key drivers of revenue for our business, highlighting which products, client categories, and cities are generating the greatest financial impact in 2024. With a total revenue of $5.36 million, the data reveals that the beer category leads impressively, accounting for 79.17% of the revenue, or approximately $4.25 million, with product 49121 standing out individually at $396 thousand, followed by 31012 ($251 thousand) and 13054 ($172 thousand). Among client types, bars contribute 53.79% ($2.88 million), while restaurants account for 46% ($2.47 million), with user 75361105, a bar in Campinas, generating $2.76 million, and user 37404863, a restaurant in Rio de Janeiro, contributing $2.39 million. Geographically, Campinas leads with 51.52% ($2.76 million), followed by Rio de Janeiro with 45.82% ($2.46 million), while SÃ£o Paulo lags with only 2.66% ($142 thousand). A valuable insight is the strength of beer among bars, especially in Campinas, while Rio de Janeiro shows diverse potential with nab generating $1.01 million in restaurants. On the other hand, shops, with a minimal contribution of just $11 thousand, and SÃ£o Paulo, with a limited share of $142 thousand, indicate areas that require attention due to underperformance. Based on this, I suggest intensifying investment in beer, prioritizing bars in Campinas and Rio de Janeiro to maximize this trend, exploring opportunities with nab in Rioâ€™s restaurants to diversify revenue, implementing revitalization strategies for shops such as promotions or new incentives, directing resources to SÃ£o Paulo to boost its relevance in revenue, and providing ongoing strategic support to clients 75361105 and 37404863 to ensure the continuity and growth of their leading performance.

PAGE 2: ANALYSIS OF RECURRENCE
The second analysis aims to identify which products and client categories demonstrate the highest order recurrence throughout 2024, providing insights into purchase consistency and behavioral patterns. The data shows that bars lead with 165 orders across 117 different days, followed by restaurants with 160 orders over 90 days, while shops account for only 29 orders in 29 days, indicating minimal participation. Among the products, beer stands out with 344 total orders, with product 49121 being the most recurrent at 116 orders over 83 days, followed by nab with 76 orders in 62 days; soda and liquor, with just 3 and 8 orders respectively, exhibit low frequency. The temporal analysis reveals a growing trend in orders throughout the year, with notable peaks in September, suggesting a potential seasonal pattern. Based on this, I recommend intensifying efforts to retain bars and restaurants, prioritizing the promotion of products like 49121 (beer) and nab, especially during peak periods such as September, while implementing incentives to boost shop recurrence and monitoring the performance of soda and liquor to explore future growth opportunities.

PAGE 3: VALUATION OF SUCCESS GOALS
The third analysis aims to assess the percentage of combinations of products, clients, and cities that successfully meet their monthly revenue targets in 2024, providing a comprehensive view of our performance against set goals. The data indicates a total revenue of $9,221 against a target of $13,600, resulting in an overall achievement of 67.80%, highlighting both strengths and areas for improvement. Notably, the user 86808677 from SÃ£o Paulo stands out by achieving 100% of the $1,200 target for nab in August ($2,529) and February ($1,339), while 83334046 from Rio de Janeiro also hit 100% for beer in February ($1,339). However, user 75361105 from Campinas, despite generating $4,480, only reached 44.80% of a challenging $10,000 target for beer in September. Bars account for 54.55% of the revenue, with Campinas leading at 54.55% among cities, yet the performance reveals significant gaps, including the fact that the product categories liquor and soda failed to meet any of their targets. Based on these insights, I recommend adjusting the targets for users like 75361105 to better reflect actual performance, recognizing the consistency of 86808677 and 83334046 with incentives, and focusing on boosting revenue from shops and SÃ£o Paulo, which lag in meeting goals. Additionally, exploring strategies to enhance beer performance in Campinas and addressing the underperformance of liquor and soda could help align results more closely with our objectives.
